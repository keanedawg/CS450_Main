For questions 2-6, please type "True" or "False" in front of the question number.

2. My experiment shell can correctly load the Iris dataset:
True
3. My experiment shell randomizes the order of the instances (making sure to keep instances lined up with their appropriate targets) it and splits the data into a training set (70%) and a test set (30%)?
True
4. I have GaussianNB algorithm on the dataset and received results.
True
5. I have created a HardCoded classifier class with two methods: fit and predict. The fit method accepts training data (including targets). The predict method returns a prediction or classification for each instance it receives.
True
6. The Experiment Shell, processes the data, passes the training data to the classifier’s train method, the test data to the predict method, and then compares the predicted values against the correct answers, to produce an overall accuracy (on the test set).
True
7. I have run the HardCoded classifier on the Iris dataset and obtained a result.
True

8. What accuracy do you get when running the HardCoded classifier on the Iris dataset and why do you think that is?
~40%, this is because I assume all plants are Setosa and roughly a third of the dataset are Setosa. 

9. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:
1 - Some attempt was made
2 - Developing, but significantly deficient
3 - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate
4 - Meets requirements
5 - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements

4

10. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category: 
All the requirements for the assignment are met and there is no attempt to go above and beyond.
